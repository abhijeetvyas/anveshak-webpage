## About Us
The team brings together a set of highly dedicated and skilled students working on   mechanical design, system architecture and control, PR and business relations. Our team participates in the University Rover Challenge(URC), an international robotics competition geared towards space exploration & research. We also organize educational workshops for students of our institute on different aspects of robotics. The technical knowledge and practical experience the team imparts to its members is unparalleled, nurturing them into effective team players and leaders of industry and research.

## University Rover Challenge (URC)
The Mars Society, USA is an organization dedicated to promote the exploration and settlement of The Red Planet. The University Rover Challenge (URC) is a project of the Mars Society aimed at promoting space technology research & development amongst students across the world, by challenging them to build the next generation of Mars rovers. Several teams from the top universities of North America, Europe, Asia and other parts of the world compete in this challenge which tests their rovers in the extreme conditions of the Mars Desert Research Station, which is akin to Martian terrain.
### Competition Tasks of URC
* <b>Science Cache Task</b>: To collect soil samples at selected sites on the field, perform scientific analysis of these samples with onboard instrumentation, and to store at least one sample in a cache for further analysis
* <b>Extreme Retrieval & Delivery Task</b>: To retrieve and deliver objects in the field, and deliver assistance to astronauts, while traversing a wide variety of terrain
* <b>Equipment Servicing Task</b>: To perform several dexterous operations such as opening valves and operating switches on a mock-up equipment system
* <b>Autonomous Traversal Task</b>: To autonomously traverse between gates and waypoints across moderately difficult terrain
## Centre for Innovation(CFI) and IIT Madras
IIT Madras, the premier institution for engineering in India, provides a base for all activities of Team Anveshak. The team is primarily funded by IIT Madras and works under the umbrella of Centre For Innovation (CFI), the student run makerspace​ laboratory of​ ​IIT Madras. More information about CFI can be found here.
